What about golden ratio!

it is found from fibonacci number like: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ..... so on.

pi is called golden ratio: (1+root5)/2 = 1.6803.....
it is an irrational number.it is found in nature's pattern.so, beautiful.
Many flowers and fruits also follow this golden ratio pattern!
like sunflower,pineapple,rose and others.
It's really  a wonder of nature that we can understand through the reasoning of mathematics.
That's why, Galleleo once said , Law of natures is written in the language of Mathematics!
